To install SASS/SCSS in my project, I first navigated into my main project folder by using the command:

cd alx-intermediate-frontend

Inside this folder, I created a new directory for the SASS/SCSS tasks with the command:

mkdir 0x03-sass_scss

After creating it, I moved into the new directory:

cd 0x03-sass_scss

Since I wanted to manage dependencies properly, I initialized npm in the directory with:

npm init -y

This generated a package.json file for the project. Next, I installed SASS locally as a development dependency by running:

npm install sass -v 3.7.4

Once the installation was complete, I verified that SASS was installed correctly by checking its version:

npx sass --version

To confirm that it worked, I created a simple style.scss file and compiled it into CSS using the command:

npx sass style.scss style.css

Finally, to make my workflow easier, I used the watch command so that any changes in my .scss file would automatically compile into CSS:

npx sass --watch style.scss:style.css

Through these steps, I successfully set up and tested SASS/SCSS in my project.
