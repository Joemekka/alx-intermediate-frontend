To install SASS/SCSS in my project, I first navigated into my main project folder by using the command:

cd alx-intermediate-frontend

Inside this folder, I created a new directory for the SASS/SCSS tasks with the command:

mkdir 0x03-sass_scss

After creating it, I moved into the new directory:

cd 0x03-sass_scss

Since I wanted to manage dependencies properly, I initialized npm in the directory with:

npm init -y

This generated a package.json file for the project. Next, I installed SASS locally as a development dependency by running:

npm install sass -v 3.7.4

Once the installation was complete, I verified that SASS was installed correctly by checking its version:

npx sass --version
